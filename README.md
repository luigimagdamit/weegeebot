# Weegeebot - LSTM Text Generator

Weegeebot is an LSTM text generator written in Python using the Keras library. The goal of the project is to generate text that impersonates the author of the training data, in this case, Luigi Magdamit.

## Installation

To run Weegeebot on your local machine, you will need to have Python and the Keras library installed. You can then clone the repository from GitHub using the following command:

bash

`git clone https://github.com/luigimagdamit/weegeebot.git` 

You will also need to download the training data file ## **model_weights_saved.hdf5** from the repository. 

## Usage

To generate text using the trained model, run the following command:

`python main.py` 

This will generate a random sequence of text that impersonates Luigi Magdamit based on the patterns in the training data.
